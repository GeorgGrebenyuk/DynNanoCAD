# About project
Slow step-by-step deeping into NanoCAD API (due to sanctions) with implementation that in Dynamo Core.
## Build
Standard building via MS VS 2017+ with single external dependence - ZeroTouch library (official dynamo's package). 
Add compiled dll-library to Dynamo and starting using package. Next I'll publish it as web-package in Dynamo's package manager.
